    <h1>Pricing and Descriptions</h1>
    <h2>Individual/Partner Private Lesson - ($45):</h2>
    <p>
      One lesson in any Ballroom style, either by yourself or with a partner.
      Pricing does not change; the set price can be split amongst both dancers.
    </p>
    <h2>Group Private Lesson - ($75+):</h2>
    <p class="group">
      One lesson in any Ballroom style, with 3+ dancers in attendance. Flat rate
      of $75 (for 3 dancers) plus an additional $20 per dancer in attendance.
      Whether parties come with even numbers of leaders and followers is up to
      the group's discretion. If uneven, partners may rotate, or instructors may
      come in as substitute partners.
    </p>
    <h2>Choreography and Routine Lessons - (TBD):</h2>
    <p class="group">
      Dancers may request Routine Consultations, lessons geared towards working
      with instructors to create a routine of their desire, or Instructor
      Choreography, where instructors demonstrate how to perform personally
      constructed routines based on dancers' descriptions. Prices can vary based
      on routine complexity.

    <h2>Wedding Day/Special Event Package - (TBD)</h2>
    <p class="group">
      Lesson package for a leader and follower looking to create choreography

      lessons. Routines may be altered at the dancer's discretion.
