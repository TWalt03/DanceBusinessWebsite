    <h1>The Mission</h1>
    <p>
      Ballroom dance and partner dancing is a joy that all individuals should be
      able to enjoy; however, the fact is that it is quite often inaccessible,
      and even beginners are expected to pay fees regularly of $100+ for
      introductory lessons to the art. Yang Ballroom and Wedding Dance brings a
      more affordable price for those eager to learn more about Ballroom in your
      local community!
